                <p><strong>1. Services Provided:</strong> The Commissioner offers various freelance services including programming, HTML/CSS, PHP/MySQL, web development, Figma mockups, customized PowerPoint presentations, logo design, Java, Python, C#, WordPress, website hosting, and domain management.</p>
    
                <p><strong>2. Downpayment:</strong> Prior to the commencement of any task, the Client shall send a downpayment amounting to 50% of the full payment, unless otherwise negotiated and agreed upon by both parties. The downpayment serves as a commitment from the Client and ensures the availability of the Commissioner's services.</p>
    
                <p><strong>3. Task Completion:</strong> The Commissioner agrees to exert their best efforts and skills in executing each task assigned by the Client. However, it is important to note that the quality and outcome of the tasks may vary based on the complexity, requirements, and collaboration between the Client and Commissioner. The Commissioner does not guarantee specific scores or results on activities provided by the Client.</p>
    
                <p><strong>4. Refund Policy:</strong> Refunds are only applicable if the Commissioner advises the Client within 24 hours of receiving the downpayment that they are unable to fulfill the assigned tasks due to unforeseen reasons. In such cases, the full downpayment shall be refunded to the Client promptly. Once the Commissioner has commenced work on the tasks, refunds will not be granted.</p>
    
                <p><strong>5. Intellectual Property:</strong> Upon the completion of a task and receipt of the full payment, the Client shall own all intellectual property rights associated with the deliverables, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. The Commissioner retains the right to showcase the completed work in their portfolio or for promotional purposes unless otherwise specified by the Client.</p>
    
                <p><strong>6. Confidentiality:</strong> The Commissioner agrees to treat all information provided by the Client as confidential and shall not disclose it to any third parties without the Client's written consent.</p>
                
                <p><strong>7. Communication:</strong> Effective communication is crucial throughout the project. The Client agrees to promptly respond to requests, provide necessary feedback, and cooperate in a timely manner. The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to keep the Client informed about the progress of the tasks.</p>
            
                <p><strong>8. Liability:</strong> The Commissioner shall not be held responsible for any loss, damage, or liability arising from the use or inability to use the services provided. The Commissioner shall also not be liable for any indirect, consequential, or incidental damages.</p>

                <p><strong>9. Amendments:</strong> The Commissioner reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time. Any changes shall be communicated to the Client and will become effective upon acceptance by the Client.</strong></p>
